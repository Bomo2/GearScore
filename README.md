# GearScore for 3.3.5a

**GearScore** is a cleaned-up version of the original GearScoreLite addon by Barsoomx.

This version is based on the original implementation but removes unused variables, legacy code paths, and redundant data structures. The goal is to simplify the codebase, reduce file size, and improve maintainability while preserving the original GearScore behavior and calculations.

By removing unused logic and unnecessary tables, tooltip generation and score display are slightly more responsive, especially during frequent mouseover events.

This project is not a rewrite, but a focused cleanup and modernization of the existing GearScoreLite code.
